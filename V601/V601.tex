\section{Ziel}\justifying
Die Kenntnis über die innere Struktur der Atome bildet für die verschiedensten Bereiche
der Physik wie die Festkörperphysik eine wichtige Rolle. Da Atome quantisiert sind können
Elektronen nur ganz bestimmte Energiewerte annehmen. Der Übergang vom Grundzustand in den
ersten angeregten Zustand wird nun mithilfe des Frank-Hertz-Versuches bestimmt.

\section{Theorie}\justifying
Der Frank-Hertz-Versuch gehört zu den Elektronenstoßexperimenten. Bei diesen 
wechselwirken Elektronen mit Atomen und durch den Energieverlust der Elektronen 
kann auf den Energieübergang zurückgeschlossen werden. Der Versuch selbst besteht
dabei aus einem evakuierten Gefäß in dem ein Tropfen Quecksilber spontan verdampft. 
Dieser verdampft so weit bis in dem Gefäß der Gleichgewichtsdruck $p_{sät} $ erreicht.
Dieser hängt von der Temperatur im Gefäß ab
\begin{align}
    p_{sät} = 5,5\cdot 10^7 \exp \left(\frac{-6876}{T} \right) \label{eq:1} \cite{V601} .
\end{align}
